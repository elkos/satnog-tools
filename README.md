# satnog-tools

This is a simple tool that I wrote to extract data from the satnogs db and create modules for gpredict that contain various groupings of satellites.

It's not production quality, but it may be useful to you if you use gpredict or if you want an example of how to communicate with the API using python.

The API interface is in a module, and you can pass in a flag to cache data locally so that you can test code without hitting the database API every time you run it.
